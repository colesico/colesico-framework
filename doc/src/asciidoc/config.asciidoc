== Colesico-Config

Automates the use of configuration beans and integrate its with the IoC container.

The general principle of using configuration beans:

* Define an abstract class of the configuration bean with abstract methods that supply configuration values or applies some options to input parameters (in case with builders).
* Add @ConfigPrototype annotation on that bean. This is indicates that the bean is a configuration prototype bean (base bean for configuration that must be extended)
* Specify the configuration model in the @ConfigPrototype annotation (see ConfigModel class).
* To obtain an instance of the configuration bean in the service use the dependency injection (depend on the configuration model)
* To define the concrete configuration values for the configuration bean extend the abstract configuration bean  (configuration prototype)
* Add @Configuration annotation to this implementation

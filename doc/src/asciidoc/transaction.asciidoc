== Colesico-Transaction

Unified support for transactions management.

Two styles of control are supported - declarative and programmatic.
These two types can be mixed.

The key component of transaction management is the TransactionalShell interface that  directly
used in programmatic management and  in the declarative under the hood.

This module does not provide a specific implementation of TransactionalShell
and does not implement any specific transaction management mechanism.
Such an implementation should be provided additionally by "vendors".

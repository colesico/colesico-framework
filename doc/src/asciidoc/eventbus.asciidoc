== Colesico-EventBus

Simple event bus support for business logic beans (services).

Provide declarative event subscription and EventBus component for sending events.

== Usage

. Define event class. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
 public class MyEvent { String message }
----

. Inject EventBus to sender bean:
+
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MySender {

    final EventBus eventBus;

    @Inject
    public Sender(EventBus eventBus) {
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
    }

}
----

. Send event with EventBus:
+
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MySender {

    final EventBus eventBus;
    ...

     public void sendEvent() {
            eventBus.send(new MyEvent(...));
     }

}
----

. Receive an event in receiver with @OnEvent annotation:
+
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class Receiver {

    @OnEvent
    public void onEvent1(MyEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Receive event: " + event.message);
    }

}
----

Event receiver should be a public, void, single argument method annotated with @OnEvent.

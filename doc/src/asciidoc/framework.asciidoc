== What is Colesico Framework?

*Colesico Framework* is a lightweight microframework for creating backend and server side web applications in Java.
It is inspired by Spring and EJB frameworks but uses more simplified approach to construct the applications.

The purpose of this framework is to provide simpler and lightweight alternative.

Colesico Framework does not almost use the reflection at runtime. The approach used is the generation of extra auxiliary code at compile time  using the annotation processors.

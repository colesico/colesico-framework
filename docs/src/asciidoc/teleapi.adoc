= Colesico-TeleAPI

The module is generally not intended for use in client applications using the framework,
but is used mainly for internal purposes.

It is used for unification the  remote method invocations API.
For example http request processing (weblet, restlet modules) uses this module to implement
remote method invocations.

TeleAPI does not directly provide any remote method call implementation.
Implementation is provided by specific modules (weblet, restlet, rcp, e.t.c.)
